Henrymail
=========
This software is intended to be an all-in-one email 
platform that's easy to configure, easy to administer,
reasonably reliable, and secure by default.

It is designed for home users or small-scale organisations.
I think the barrier to entry for setting up an existing 
mail server applications is too high. This project is 
intended to fix that.

The software is not designed to scale, or to suit 
enterprise users. Individual components (e.g. the mail 
transfer agent) are not replaceable with other 
software. This is an all in-in-one package only.

The software is currently INCOMPLETE. It may contain 
security issues, or bugs that will result in data-loss.
It has not yet been translated or tested for accessibilty.
Use it at your own risk. If you choose to use it, 
I would love to hear your feedback. Please raise any 
issues [in the project repository](https://gogs.mfashby.net/martin/henrymail/issues)
, or [send me an email](martin@ashbysoft.com)
